		30 February & Initial infrastructure setup. This involves building the train-validate-test loops, building the data ingest/transformation pipelines, and building the model-building pipelines. This is feasible since much of the code will be taken from the IRIS Seminar project. \\
		15 March    & Integration of all modules as well as integration of hyperparameter optimization and training-tracking code complete. Initial training/debugging of the network can begin.                                                        \\
		30 March    & Parallelization of reinforcement-learning and deep-learning components of the network are complete. This involves making it possible to run the reinforcement-learning and the deep-learning models on separate computers during training, if this improves performance. \\
		15 April    & Initial results should be done by now, bugs will be found and ``beta-testing'' of the framework is in full swing. All results at this point are taken with a massive grain of salt since something will cause the results to be wrong, speaking from experience. \\
		30 April    & Initial good results should be available. Deeper investigations through hyperparameter optimization and changes to the model architecture should now start or is already ongoing.                                                         \\
		30 May      & Final results from the experiments should be completed.                                                                                                                                                                 \\
		30 June     & First draft of the paper is done.                                                                                                                                                                                      \\
		7 July      & Second draft of the paper is done.                                                                                                                                                                                     \\
		14 July     & Final draft of the paper is done.                                                                                                                                                                                      \\
		21-28 July  & Somewhere in these two weeks, the thesis defense should take place.                                                                                                                                                       \\ \bottomrule
