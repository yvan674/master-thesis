I would like to express my gratitude to the following:

To my supervisors Nirvana and Bram for giving up their time to guide me, and quite thoroughly, through this thesis,

To my friends, those of you in the DSAI masters with me and our group Belly Dancing as a Service and those of you in Pattern.

To my family, who supported me throughout the entirety of my masters.
